## Invite-only Registration

This is the repository that goes alongside the [Invite-only Registration](https://fly.io/laravel-bytes/invite-only-registration/) article on Fly.io.

In the article, we'll continue building on what we made in the [User Levels, Enums and Policies, oh my!](https://fly.io/laravel-bytes/user-levels-enums-and-policies-oh-my/) article. We'll make our app more exclusive by requiring an invite to register. Along the way we'll meet some challenges and quirks but worry not, I will guide you through them. 

Here are the steps in more detail:

- Setting it up for the first user
- Creating invites
- Notifying new users
- Registering new users

Along the way, we'll learn about Middleware, Notifications, Signed URLs and more.

Every section in the article has its own pull request:
